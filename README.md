- **Gravity Mechanics**: The dino falls when not on a platform.
- **Score System**: Your score increases as the dino travels upwards.
- **Responsive Controls**: Move the dino left or right using arrow keys.
- **Game Over & Restart**: The game restarts when the dino falls off the board.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in a browser.
2. Use the **Arrow Right** key to move the dino to the right.
3. Use the **Arrow Left** key to move the dino to the left.

## Game Logic

- **Dino**: The main character, which you control. The dino can move left or right using the arrow keys and must land on platforms to avoid falling.
- **Platforms**: These are where the dino jumps to. They come in three types:
  1. **Static** platforms stay in place.
  2. **Moving** platforms move left and right.
  3. **Disappearing** platforms disappear when touched by the dino.
- **Gravity**: If the dino isn't on a platform, gravity pulls it downward until it lands on a platform.
